Today was almost most certainly not the easiest thing I could do for this course. 
I wanted to simply upload photos of my time at Texas A&M University. 
I had way more photos planned besides the original two, but I had issues getting my files to commit under the right thing and have them uploaded onto my blog.
This week's activity took a lot of patience and I still have more that I can do to make my blog look, overall, much nicer.
I chose to upload photos of my time at Texas A&M because I am a graduating senior this semester and I want to reminisce a little bit.
Once I have more time I will be sure to upload more photos to the post.
