[Here are my old notes that I am referencing.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eVIr36tOuGYTMOamHeHU4s5lheZbA2TDvKBnQct0v3I/edit?usp=sharing)

After reviewing everything in this chapter, because it is so long and chalk full of information, I started to research more about markup and thought that for this weekâ€™s reflective blog I would actually use one of my old documents as my reference point. 
This old doc is actually my notes from my Journalism 489: Multimedia Journalism Mobile class this past spring. 
If you remember from this past spring, it got cut and we had to start meeting online. 
I will say that it is shorter because of that, as I stopped taking as organized of notes, but the early concept of this document is what lead me to choose to reference it. 
While reading this chapter on Markup, our first encounter was how documents were even organized and formatted. 
This immediately got me to thinking about how I personally organized my own documents. 
I must say, I used to be horrible at formatting my documents until I finally took my scientific and technical writing English course. 
It was not until that professor broke down exactly how Microsoft Word and Google Docs have tools to give the document the exact information we are trying to express. 
I seriously used to wonder how people had pdfs and other file types that were interactive, as in you could click on a tab in a table of contents and it would bring you to that section immediately. 
I was not aware that that was information that I could embed into my own documents. 
Moving forward to Web Documents Markdown and Semantic Web Documents HTML I now get to learn how that coding is written and formatted behind closed doors. 
These sections provided a whole lot of information that I was not expecting to necessarily learn ever. 
I will be honest, I have read through the entire chapter twice and have looked back at different sections throughout this past week and am still struggling to fully know everything. 
I think that is the point though. 
I am not sure that I will ever have all of those things memorized and be able to perform those actions perfectly every time. 
This is a new language for me after all. 
The concept of these topics is where I want to spend my focus. 
Though I may not ever be able to perform these actions fully, I feel as though the concepts are generally easy to understand and the transfer of the code to what happens in the document makes sense. 
I know that most of the information in this chapter was vocabulary overload, but I can at least tell visually how one thing translates to another. 
It will take me a bit to fully understand it all, but I am happy to have these lessons easily accessible for me to look over whenever I need to.
