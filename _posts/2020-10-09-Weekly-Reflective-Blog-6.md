This week I know I was supposed to take the time to consider everything we have learned and make the effort to put what I am not understanding before everything to develop my blog into something that best executes my style.
There are definitely a few things that I will have to go over and clarify the process on before my blog will really be able to take shape to what I want it to be.

<h2>I want my blog to have a clear navigation bar.</h2>

I am personally a very organized person and am able to comprehend the idea of html use.
I, however, am struggling to make my blog itself look more organized.
This feature is important to me because I was taught that any professional web page for a business would be able to clearly direct the consumer to what they are looking for.
I not only want my navigation on my site to be clear for me, but also for anyone else who may visit my site, or if I am helping build a website for a company in the future.

<h2>I want my blog to have a different theme.</h2>

If you are looking at my blog right you might be thinking that this is just for student use or that the person is just getting into web design.
And you would be correct because I am both of those things!
But I want this opportunity to showcase myself as a learner and someone who is willing to grow as well.
The theme for my blog needs to be changed to have a color that may not be so standardized.
The current blue color used is pretty, but I know it is used too much for my personality.
I want to express to anyone who visits this site that, yes, I am a student and there are bugs to fix and I may not be the strongest writer, but donâ€™t I seem fun and showcase that I am willing to work at something?

<h2>I want my blog to showcase photos in a readable size.</h2>

The photos I have on my blog show up well, but they take up the entire screen.
I need to be able to adjust photo, video, and other media sizes to fit on the computer screen accurately. 
This is important to me because my final project for this course is likely to involve photos and possibly other multimedia formats.
I also know that images are accepted by the entire world instead of just one group who speaks one language.
That skillset will be important for the line of work that I am hoping to get into once I graduate this semester.

Overall, I believe that finding out exactly what I need help with has been a huge help to then allow me to ask for guidance in how to approach these topics with my professor.
As I said before, I like to have everything organized so that I can understand what exactly needs to get done!
