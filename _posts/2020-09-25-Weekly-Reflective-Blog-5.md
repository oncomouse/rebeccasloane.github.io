To put it simply: I have no style.
Well, I guess that is not entirely true.
I have style, and I have several ideas for how I would like my website to look, but I am struggling to execute the ideas in my head.
What my blog is right now, as of October second of twenty twenty, is not this.

Now, I know what my fellow classmates and professor are probably thinking right now.

“What is so difficult?”

“There is a whole lesson that you just read!”

“Is it really so tough to implement your ideas?”

And to answer that last question, yes, it is really that tough for me! 
After spending a total of 3 different trial and error dates, I am at a loss for implementing my style into my blog at the moment.

What I have come to realize is that with each lesson, the tasks become harder.
This is simply because individually, we get to make choices for ourselves on what our blogs get to look like and contain.
Not everything that you may want on your blog is going to be written out exclusively to how you would like to showcase your ideas.

I understand that as a generation, this student group is quick to ask questions to get answers first before actually doing the most personal research possible.
For me, and with how this lesson has gone, by simply reading just the lesson plan, I have come to the conclusion that I will probably need to research more about GitHub styling and possibly find instructions on how to implement exactly what I want.
There is no fault to this; as I said before, not everything we individually want to implement is outlined in our lesson plans.

My tasks in addition to next week’s plan is to try to find outside sourcing to execute style on my navigation menu, but also my website as a whole.
I typically work 8 a.m.-5 p.m. and am not able to make the office hours times available during the week and therefore will have to put in extra effort to meeting with my professor and understanding what I will need to do in my coding to make sure my blog is truly reflective of my style.

I did not think that I would have to ever post that I failed at learning something for this class, but it honestly is not surprising to me.
This is still a whole new language and I am very mediocre at it still.
I am not disappointed in myself because I believe that this struggle will help me to realize the help I may need when it comes to the final project. 
I would much rather fail early enough to learn and improve, rather than get to the final project and always be in a limbo because I do not understand how to execute my style to thebest of my capabilities.
