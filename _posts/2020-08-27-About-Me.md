Howdy!

My name is Rebecca Sloane and I am a senior journalism major at Texas A&M University. I also carry two minors along with my major coursework: English and horticulture. I am graduating this semester and am interested in working in public relations for a company after graduation.

I have enjoyed my English courses and honestly did not know what to expect from this course--ENGL 460 Digital Authoring Practices. When reading the description for this class I did expect to learn about ethics or ways in which a writer would present themselves or collaborate with a digital author. After now being in the class for a week I am slightly blown away at what is expected of me and what I will be learning. I must say, though, that I feel that these skills will be useful to me one day. Though it is unexpected, I am happy to be in this class and put in effort to something that I did not feel capable of before.

I am excited to see how this semester goes. Thank you for having me!

Thanks and Gig'em,

Rebecca Sloane '21
