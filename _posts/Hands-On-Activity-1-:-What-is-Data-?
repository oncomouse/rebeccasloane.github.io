**Team Member Cards**
For the team member cards, the type of data needed is plainly a name, title, and description (biography). I personally think that with the Member Cards, it is the most effective way that I could imagine a researcher looking up the different members of a team. The researcher is able to easily locate the specific person they may be looking for with a name and title. Further, when the tab is clicked on, their biography is revealed with possibly other information. For the purpose of having team member or employee information in this system there may need to be another content box for contact purposes. This type of visualization could also be used for different products for a business by producing an image, title, and informational subheading with an extended biography and possibly more images. This visualization seems very much fitted for the world of business.

**The Demographics of Others**
The Demographics of Others is done very interestingly where a researcher is able to specifically find out different pieces of information about certain groups of individuals. I think that when being specific to certain groups of individuals, this type of visualization helps a researcher compare parts of information to other parts of information about one specific group and one specific group only. Where this visualization fails is being able to compare two different groups to each other. The researcher has to go back and forth between the two, or multiple, groups. There are certain reasons to use this type of visualization for but it is highly specific that it focuses only on one group at a time.

**“Based on a True Story”**
I had never seen a timeline laid out so interestingly. I liked the simplicity of that there are only five colors/categories. This makes it simple to read and focuses on the timeline of one thing; in this case, films. I can easily find a scene in the film and know by the color if it is true, false, or unknown. If we were to look at other types of timelines for instance, musically or historically, I would have to go into deeper thought on the effectiveness. Musically, I can see it relating very similarly to films (or any visual media type for that instance) with certain pieces of the song being lyrically written out and/or described. For history, however, I feel that off the bat there would be too many colors and noise in its presentation. The timeline would have to become more specific. Though I like this visualization, it seems that it must be rather specific for a researcher to read the visualization easily and thoroughly.
